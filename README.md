# AlphaWare

AlphaWare is a Python-based application designed to protect sensitive information on Windows systems through advanced data encryption and security measures. It utilizes the `cryptography` library to provide robust encryption for your files, ensuring your data remains secure.

## Features

- **File Encryption**: Encrypt files to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
- **File Decryption**: Decrypt files to access your protected data when needed.
- **Key Management**: Automatically generates and manages encryption keys.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `cryptography` library

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install the `cryptography` package using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install cryptography
   ```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `alphaware.py` file.
2. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python alphaware.py
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to encrypt or decrypt your files.

## Security Note

- Keep your encryption key file (`key.key`) secure, as it is necessary for decrypting your files.
- Backup your key file separately to avoid data loss.
